# **DragMania**

DragMania is a multilayer game created for Android devices as the main project for the course TDT4240 Software Architecture at NTNU. 

The game is based on the activity “Red Light, Green Light”. The players are playing on separate devices,
and the screen shows their own car as well as their own and their opponent's score and a policeman. When the policeman is facing
the car, the players will get a time penalty if they are still driving. The first player to cross the finish line wins.
